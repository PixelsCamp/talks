Description
-----------

Episode I-VIII, AGILE WARS is the period of the war on Agility. 

“_The year was 2001, the galaxy was Utah...17 brave Jedi's got together to create the manifesto that would change the face of the galaxy.
When they created the manifesto they began to spread the force around the universe and some Jedi learners managed to control their anger and will for power, however, others did not and began to create the Empire.
Rebel Agilist striking from hidden homes all over the galaxy are losing their battle against the evil “We DO Agile” Galactic Empire. 
During the battle, Scrumtroopers managed to steal secret plans in order to create the Empire’s ultimate weapon, the SPOTIFY MODEL, an armored space blog with enough power to destroy an entire planet, even though without that purpose
Pursued by the Empire’s sinister agents, Princess Lean races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore Agility to the galaxy._”

As fans of the saga and through a story with parallels with Star Wars, we hope to share and explain our vision of the dark days that Agile is currently facing and how to shed some light for the days to come.

_With you, Agility may be! (Yoda)_
