Description

OWASP Juice Shop is an intentionally insecure webapp for security
trainings written entirely in Javascript which encompasses the entire
OWASP Top Ten and many more severe and complex security flaws.

In this talk, you'll learn about this open-source project and its
capabilities first-hand from its creator. You are invited on a happy
shopper round trip and will have the chance to see some hacking demos of
several of the built-in challenges. You'll also witness how to apply
custom themes to the Juice Shop to make it your company's next security
awareness super-weapon. Last but not least, you will experience how to
set up a capture-the-flag (CTF) event with the Juice Shop in less than 5
minutes!
