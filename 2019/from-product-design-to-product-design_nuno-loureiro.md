Description
-----------

I've been a designer for 20 years. I started as a Product designer for everyday objects but had many roles throughout my career: web designer, digital designer, UX designer... you name it...

Now the new normal is Product Design again, but this time digital. I will talk about both worlds, their differences, similarities, and tools.
