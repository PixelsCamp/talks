Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are an important primitive which allow multiple
nodes to collaboratively store and retrieve data in a completely decentralized
network. Nowadays, millions of users are using projects and service which rely
on DHTs: Bittorrent, IPFS, Freenet, Ethereum are just examples of projects
leveraging DHTs to store and retrieve data in decentralized networks. With the
upcoming Web 3.0, it is only expected that DHTs will become even more important
in future Internet applications.

The most popular DHT vanilla protocols leak information about which users are
storing and retrieving what files, making it easy for adversaries to gather data
that can be correlated to understand what network users are up to. The data
leaked can be used by adversaries for mass surveillance, censorship and privacy
attacks on DHT users.

In this talk, we first dive into what are DHTs, how they work and how is user
activity data leaked. After motivating the reasons of why anonymous and private
systems are important for the future the internet and society, we'll perform a
live privacy attack on a public DHT. We will see how easy it is to harvest and
correlate public activity in DHTs and generate usage profiles that can be used
against DHT users.

We will also go through some techniques and protocols to harden privacy in DHTs
based on current research and applications such as onion routing,
friend-to-friend routing, and others.
