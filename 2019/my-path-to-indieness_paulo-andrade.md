Description
-----------

I've been trying to bootstrap my own software business for a long, long time. For over 10 years to be more precise. Last year I finally made the jump.

My first attempt was in 2007, with [Survs](https://survs.com). An online survey tool that's now been available for over 10 years. More recently I launched [Secrets](https://outercorner.com/secrets/) a password manager for Mac and iOS which is now my main source of income.

In the meantime I worked as a systems administrator at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), built iOS apps at [SAPO](https://www.sapo.pt) and did contracting for Apple.

Along the way I've learnt a few things related to bootstrapping your business and, a bit like Nanny Mcphee, I have 5 lessons I want to share. I'll back these lessons with episodes from this journey, including one where my work somehow played a part in the Arab Spring.

Disclaimer: This is not a tech talk. It's about not making some of the mistakes I've made and setting yourself up to succeed.
