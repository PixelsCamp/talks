you. and the morals of technology
=================================

* Length    : 30 minutes

Description
-----------

As the apps we build have more and more room in our daily routine, in our
relationships and connectedness, we are increasingly faced with moral dilemmas
regarding their usage. We are the architects and the pillars of the digital
world. We have the ability to influence the lives of hundreds, thousands or
millions of people. For the first time in history, there is a community capable
of building something with little to no resources. How can we, as a community,
use this super-power to create a greater good?

Extra Information
-----------------

This talk is more of a philosophical talk rather than a technical one. I want to
bring this discussion to the development community since it is strongly built on
open source and cooperation. I believe these communities have the biggest role
in using technology to impact local groups. I have been working with an open
source group of volunteers in Braga, Portugal (and hopefully will be doing the
same in London during the next year) to apply technology into helping people and
institutions in need. So far we have been working with volunteer firefighters to
help them manage their headquarters and their staff, their emergency alerts. We
have also helped over 300 institutionalised children (orphans, children removed
from their parents due to abuse or lack of economic/social conditions) by
creating a digital Secret Santa event. I will dive into the teachings from those
experiences, reflect on the role of developers in the real world and how they
can have a lasting impact.

I truly believe smaller development communities can have a practical and lasting
impact in their own local society. I won’t delve into philosophy much and rather
focus on making a practical impact through technology. I will go into the
morality of a developer’s role, both as a career and outside of it. I will
explain how I felt disconnected with the lack of impact of the so called global
non-profits and turned my focus into the local community through open source. I
really believe this is a healthy discussion for the developers to have and by
itself we can bring a different take on the usual conference talk points.
