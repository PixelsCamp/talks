Description

When I arrived Talkdesk in October 2016 I found a company with  60 engineers splitted in scrum teams and there were only 2 functional testers. The testers had a very good knowledge about the product but they were not part of any team and were working in firefighter mode. At the time we didn’t have any QA process nor a Test Management Tool.
 
Nowadays the company is still growing. The engineering team has 100 people and we are 7 testers. For now, each tester works with 2 engineering teams, and participates in the team's activities. We’re building a QA process on which we are continuously evolving to fit the company needs. Our impact on the teams is visible not only in our sprints but also production deploys.

On one side, I will show the path we went through from the moment I joined the company until now, focusing on the challenges that came across and how we overcome them:
* Hiring more people
* Choosing a test management tool
* Changing mentalities and overcome QA related prejudices
* Allocating testers and making them part of the teams
* Defining a QA process and training people
* Managing all QA activities

On the other side, I will also go through the challenges coming ahead and the way we are thinking to approach them: 
* Test Automation
* Continuous deploy
* Having 1 tester per team

With this presentation I want to emphasise the importance for a company to have a QA process and  also receive feedback and inputs on the challenging path we have ahead.
