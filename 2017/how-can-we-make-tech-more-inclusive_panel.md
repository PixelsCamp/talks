Description
-----------

With the help from Feedzai, we will be discussing some of the myths about diversity in tech, what’s stopping minorities from entering and staying in STEM and how can we all contribute to make tech more inclusive. The truth is, we are building the society of the future and if our community isn’t diverse and inclusive now, we risk building a society that will continue to reinforce harmful biases and unfair disadvantages that will affect up to 80% of the world population.

This panel will open the conversation for Q&A with the audience.
