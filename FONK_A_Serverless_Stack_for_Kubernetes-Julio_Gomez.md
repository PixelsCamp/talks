=========================

* Speaker   : Julio Gomez
* Available : Thu since 12pm to Friday 2pm
* Length    : 30 minutes
* Language  : English (or Spanish)

Description
-----------

For many years you have used LAMP stacks for your web projects. Now serverless offers multiple benefits around optimization and cost, but maybe you are not sure how to use it. Probably you are even concerned about the lock-in when using public cloud managed offerings.

FONK is an evolution of the LAMP idea, but focused on open-source serverless application architectures, with the goal of avoiding lock-in. This session will discuss FONK (F=FaaS, O=Object store, N=NoSQL, K=Kubernetes) concepts and demonstrate how they apply to example web applications. 

Demos will be held. Also awkward silences.
