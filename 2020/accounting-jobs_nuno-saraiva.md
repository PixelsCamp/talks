Description
-----------

Artificial intelligence will kill accounting. Blockchain will make it reborn.

In this talk I will show how AI and machine learning will replace 90% of the current work of accountants, very soon.
In addition I will talk about my vision of the future of corporate financial reporting and accounting records that will be stored in peer-to-peer networks using blockchain and ensuring error-free accounting.
