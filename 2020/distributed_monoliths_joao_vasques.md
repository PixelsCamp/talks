Distributed Monoliths
=================================================

* Length    : 45 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

If you don't treat Data as a first class citizen, almost all microservices architectures are nothing more than a Distributed Monolith. One aspect of microservices that is often neglected is the way Data is managed, shared and consumed accross the entire system. The purpose of the talk is to answer the following questions.

+ What is a Distributed Monolith?
+ What are the consequences of a Distributed Monolith?
+ How do we make sure our system is exposing the right Data in a standard format?
+ How to handle different different levels of consistency?
+ How can we avoid the centralized traditional ETL platform that needs to understand every piece of business logic in each microservice?
+ How is Unbabel avoiding the Distributed Monolith trap?
