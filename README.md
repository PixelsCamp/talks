# [Pixels Camp 2016](https://pixels.camp) Call for Talks


## How to submit a talk

Talks proposals are handled through GitHub pull requests. Follow the instructions below:

* Log in to **GitHub** or create an account.
* **Fork this repository**.
* **Duplicate** the [my-awesome-talk_my-name.md](https://github.com/PixelsCamp/talks/blob/master/my-awesome-talk_my-name.md) file first and rename the **new file** after your talk title and your name.  
(ex: pixels-camp-is-going-to-be-legen-dary_celso-martinho.md)
* Edit the **new file** and fill in each section.
* **Do not delete the template file.**
* When you're ready, **submit a pull request** and **comment** using your markdown file contents.
* Anyone can comment your pull request. If your talk is accepted we will merge it.
* Deadline for submitting talks is **July 31st**. After than we won't be accepting more pull requests.
* We will respond to everyone who submits a proposal even if it's not accepted.


## What should be in the proposal?

Every proposal should have, at minimum, the following information: 

* Your Name
* Your Availability (what days/times you are able to do this presentation)
* Presentation Title
* Presentation Description
* Presentation Duration (typically 30 mins, but we're open minded)
* Presentation Language


#### Related Files

If you want to include any other files related to your presentation, like keynotes, code samples, videos, etc, make a directory with the same name as your presentation and put the files in there.

#### Contact Info

Make sure we have a way to contact you! Either set up your e-mail address in your GitHub profile, or include it on your proposal.


## What are we looking for?

#### Relevance

Is the talk relevant for the PixelsCamp attendance? Namely, would it make sense for a bunch of nerds to sit through your talk in the context of a technological event?  
Relevance is tricky as it doesn’t necessarily translate to geeky or codable. Sometimes interesting talks show up and aren’t even related to technology.

#### Novelty

Is it old news? Has it been heavily discussed in the past? Sometimes good talks get rejected because they get old. Try to awe the attendees with some fresh insights!
