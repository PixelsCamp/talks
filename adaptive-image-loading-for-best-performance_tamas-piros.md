Description
-----------

The web has seen incredible growth over the past decade - an increase that enabled remarkable technological advancement. There are developer tools and frameworks out there that can do magical things and unfortunately, therein lies the problem. With this explosion of new tools as well as myriad device types, we are faced with another problem - performance.
In the era of JavaScript frameworks, there is an ever increasing number of resources that a website requires. When one stops to think about it, these days we need multiple JavaScript files, CSS files and other resources, as well as media assets such as images and videos.
Creating a website that performs well is a constant challenge as there are many factors to take into consideration such as the connection speed of the user and the capabilities of the device used to access the site.
Asset management is always an important factor in web applications, primarily because recent years have seen an increase in visually appealing websites. More images are added to websites, but this comes with an undesired effect - often leading to slower load times.
There are web applications that could lose profit if images do not load fast enough - think about e-commerce websites. The profitability of such sites depends on garnering a reasonable conversion rate. A few seconds in delay when loading product information could cause a potential buyer to leave the site prematurely.
During the talk we'll discuss how to achieve well performing website without the penalty of loosing a visual experience.
