Description
-----------


Behind every tiny search box lays a piece of complex engineering routines powered by a hidden field of science, Information Retrieval. Ingenious algorithms define the way we find what we are searching for, from a vast pool of stored documents.

**What happens when I type in the search box?**

This talk will guide us through the typical journey of a text query. We will start with an overview of the field of Information Retrieval, from the historical roots to more recent methods. We will then explain the problems and motivate our quest in finding the "golden goose" with "golden shoes". A path full of misspellings, acronyms and out-of-domain words. This study resulted in Semantic Search, a key part of Farfetch's search engine, responsible for query understanding. (this was also presented as a scientific publication on the AI for fashion workshop at KDD 2018¹)
