Description
-----------
After a long time sitting in the "Peak of Inflated Expectations" and "death by a thousand prototypes" the Internet of Things (IoT) is finally delivering strong, mass-market, solutions. 
This year is already proving to be game changing with key players like Alibaba setting targets of 1 Billion connected devices.

In this talk we explore the motivations driving the IoT, the current directions and take a twist into what can we learn from biology to inform its future path.
 
We'll then look at practical use cases where the IoT - through a combination of accessible connectivity, low power devices and System Flexibility - presents new opportunities and insights from everyday things.


Speaker Bio
-----------

Originally from Setubal (Portugal) Jose is the IoT Solutions Architect at Reece Innovation, a large Engineering group in the North East of UK - the epicentre of the indutrial revulution of the 1800s.

Previous workplaces have included Pycom - makers of popular ESP32 based MicroPython boards with ample connectivity options - and  his company Metavurt. 

He has experience in applying various sensor and connectivity options - Bluetooth, LoRa, Sigfox, and LTE/NB-IoT - to 'mine' new information and opportunities from existing systems.
When not soldering something or trying some new chip he's a regular speaker at various IoT Meetups (Newcastle, Leeds, Amsterdam) and larger events such as Things Conference. 

Other interests include studying generalised networks and their applications e.g. in brain connectivity.
