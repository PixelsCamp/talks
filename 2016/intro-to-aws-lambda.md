Introduction to AWS Lambda and serverless architectures
========================

* Speaker   : Carlos Sanchiz
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

Server-less architectures allow you to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. Your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by AWS. You no longer have to provision, scale, and maintain servers to run your applications, databases, and storage systems. In this session we will briefly introduce AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway and DynamoDB and give a quick tour around the user experience with the AWS Console
