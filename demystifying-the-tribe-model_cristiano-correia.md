**Demystifying the Tribe Model**

The Spotify Tribe Model is THE buzz-word of the Agile world and a lot of organizations consider using it.

Having experienced a form of it on first-hand on one of the largest organizations in the world, gave me a sense on how this can help or hurt an organization.

Although Scrum is the most common framework, it might not be the best solution for big scalable teams and the Spotify Tribe Model comes as answer to that.

What it is, where it started, who should use it, why and when should you consider it: The 5Ws of the Tribe Model.

With a background in engineering and design, my focus has always been building great products and great experiences.

I've been working continuously as a Frontend Engineer and UX Designer since 2012 across Portugal, Belgium, The Netherlands and Germany on a multitude of roles ranging from design, development and management. Currently I'm a Scrum Master at Critical TechWorks (a BMW Group & Critical Software company) and a tutor at EDIT.

Having contributed to and used multiple Design Systems, that's my favorite way of mixing both of my backgrounds on a project. I also have a soft spot for Accessibility and I'm always focused on trying to deliver in the most Agile way.
