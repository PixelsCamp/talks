Description
-----------

Reactive is the new black, Everyone talks about it, everyone wants it! However the definition is quite fuzzy, what does it mean? Reactive Programming? Reactive Systems? Functional Reactive Programming?

In this talk I will focus on the first two: Reactive Programming and Reactive Systems. Reactive programming has become mainstream in the JavaScript community, both on the server side with NodeJS as well on the frontend side with React.js. Finally it is catching up on the Java community with Vert.x and Spring 5. But are all these platforms, reactive systems? The answer is: No! We will demystify the differences and tear down false believes!

This talk is not for the faint of hear! Be prepared to see your stack being put to the test and perhaps it will prevail!

---------------

The talk is around the concepts of the reactive manifesto. Since its release the term “reactive” has been used in a very loose manner however there are about 3 categories one can identify:

1. Reactive Programming (event driven, asynchronous)
2. Reactive Systems
3. Functional Reactive Programming

The first item is the pilar of platforms such as node and spring 5 but the underlying foundation are not necessarily reactive systems. Why does it matter? because if one looks carefully at the manifesto it stands out that application on such environments will not scale/perform as most people believe.

The second item will be discussed and shown using existing frameworks (e.g.: eclipse vert.x) that it adds another layer of scalability and performance to the user application, making it more resilient and efficient.

The talk will be around several code examples, demonstrating in a informal way what reactive really means so we can all build fast scalable and performant application!

Speaker Bio
-----------

I'm Paulo and I've used my 10+ years of software development experience writing, rewriting, banging my head against the wall, editing and re-editing high-performance web application to make Vert.x an even more awesome framework. I am also the author of "yoke" and other small open source projects. I jump out of bed with a big smile on my face each morning because I know reactive microservices are real and will finally put monoliths and big balls of mud to an end. This is more than a job; I'm on a mission to build fast and faster applications!
