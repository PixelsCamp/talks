Description
-----------

A simple syntax, a large ecosystem, and a great community make Javascript one of the top programming languages of 2020. But don't be fooled by its ease of use! This is a tricky language and it has some nuances that if you are not careful, it can put you in serious trouble. In this talk, I will identify and explain some of the pitfalls of this amazing language and give you some precious knowledge that one day might probably save your life.

Extra Information
-----------------

In this talk, I will use humor to pinpoint some particularities of the language that are prone to mistakes and I will unveil (with some theory) what's going on "behind the hood". I have no recordings of my previous talks. I've been giving talks in meetups with less than 50 people and for 2020 I will be submitting talks for bigger events. I hope to have an opportunity at Pixels Camp and I will be available if you need any additional information.
