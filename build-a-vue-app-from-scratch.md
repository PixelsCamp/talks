Description
-----------

Vue.js (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a library for building interactive web interfaces. The goal of Vue.js is to provide the benefits of reactive data binding and composable view components with an API that is as simple as possible. Vue community has been growing in the last years and now has more than 125k stars on GitHub.

In this workshop, we will create a Vue application from scratch using the Vue CLI 3. By the end of it, we will be able to:

* Create a vue app from scratch with Vue CLI 3
* Work with Single File Components (*.vue files)
* Understand the lifecycle of a Vue component
* Know many ways to communicate between components
* Use vue-router to manage application routes
* Understand how to use VUEX as a centralized store for an application
