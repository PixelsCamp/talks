Description
-----------

What if i told you that you can build a CMS powered website, complete with
search and automated deploys with no database, server or the need for backend
developers?

I'll show you!

This talk will cover the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) philosophy, static website generators and the
services currently available to get your project up and running at zero cost.

Speaker Bio
-----------

I'm an old-man-from-restelo, who started doing websites in the '90s and
currently does, but hates, modern front-end development.
I'm the "vanilla forever" guy...

I currently work at Bright Pixel and I'm the main developer of Pixels Camp's
website.

I previously worked at SAPO and was the sole front-end developer for the
previous 2 versions of the portal's homepage, the highest traffic portuguese
website.

I have a passion for standards, minimalist code and optimization (meaning I've
got OCD). I'm also a f\*cking weeaboo who loves Sailor Moon, and takes japanese
classes.

Extra Information
-----------------

I have not given any talks yet because I'm usually stuck at Pixels Camp coding
stuff to meet the attendees' needs. I'm also awake during the full length of
the event.
