Description
-----------

Artificial Intelligence is all the hype these days. Cheap compute resources and
huge amounts of data have allowed unprecedented achievements with Neural
Networks, which have in turn attracted a lot of research to the area, fueling a
cycle of new discoveries and new progress. In areas such as image processing,
speech, language and translations, Neural Network techniques have been well
studied, understood, and packaged as off-the-shelf solutions anyone can use. For
other areas such as interpretation or writing of computer programs, this is not
yet the case.

Spatial (eg: image) and sequence (eg: language) processing have taken advantage
of well-established NN architectures based on CNNs (Convolutional Neural
Networks) or RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks). Problems such as interpreting
computer code are not a good match for either because programs aren't suited for
either representation.

In this talk, we'll meet a new family of Neural Networks that operate on Graphs.
These networks open the possibility to push the state of the art in processing
graph-structured data such as computer programs or molecules. We'll also walk
through some new achievements in AI-assisted development that GNNs have enabled.

Extra Information
-----------------

The proposed talk consists of &mdash; a brief introduction to Neural Networks
and how they work; what's the difference of CNNs and RNNs and why it matters;
how do GNNs differ from those architectures and why it matters when dealing with
programming code; what kinds of tasks can GNNs do for programmers nowadays; what
things can we expect them to bring in the future.

The intended audience should have at least a basic understanding of programming
but no previous experience with machine-learning is required.

My last talk in PixelsCamp was about a completely different topic &mdash; TypeScript.
