Description
-----------

Have you heard about Elixir? What makes it interesting? Why should you care?

We will cover what makes Elixir so special and how you can leverage that potential with the next unicorn in Lisbon - Image to Emojis as a Service! I will guide you through a code example and we will talk about supervision trees, interoperability with other languages and concurrency/parallelism in the Elixir world.

After this, I hope you'll have a clearer view about whether if Elixir is a good fit for your next project.
