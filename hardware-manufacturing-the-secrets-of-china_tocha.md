 +
 +After graduating from ISCTE, I had the privilege to work in a new and exciting startup focused on developing an innovative product. The journey became so amazing that I decided to move to China in order to be closer to the factories and suppliers, this gave me not only knowledge but also amazing experiences. Now, I dedicate my days to helping other young entrepreneurs making their visions grow into real products so they can offer the world their new and exciting ideas.
 +I'm currently working at China Facture, a company focused on helping start-ups to transform their ideas into real mass market products.
