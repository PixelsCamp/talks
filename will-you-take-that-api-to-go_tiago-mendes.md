Description
-----------

Wouldn't it be great to be able to develop a fully functional API without the hassle of learning a third party library or framework? What if I told you that Go lets you do all this, with an awesome concurrency system out of the box?

In this talk, I will show you how you can quickly build a fully functional, and tested API, that goes beyond a mere "Hello World" message, using just the Go standard library for this purpose. As a bonus, I will go through some tips, techniques and good practices of the language!
