Description
-----------

`Raspberry Pis` have been there like forever, and have sold like hot cakes for 16 years now. Lots of people have done very ambitious projects ([self driving robot](https://github.com/bdjukic/selfdriving-robot-car), anyone?), and new ideas and projects surface *everyday*. Be it building a supercomputer by stacking lots of SBCs, a [bitcoin miner](https://hub.packtpub.com/how-mine-bitcoin-your-raspberry-pi/), a [brewery system](https://www.brewpi.com/), home [automation](https://www.home-assistant.io/), a [weather station](http://airpi.es/whatisthis.php) or any [crazy idea](https://www.bestvpn.com/guides/raspberry-pi-projects/), the only limit seems to be your imagination.

Of course, these little beasts can also be used as `servers`. For years, Docker has been used only on big `servers`, but after  [resin.io](https://resin.io/blog/why-port-docker-to-the-raspberry-pi/) ported Docker to the Arm processor, everything changed.

Pretty cool to be able to run Docker on that kind of mini machines,  but what kind of service could you run on Docker with so little memory? Lots of things in fact…

And what if you could get the best of both worlds? What could you do  with a machine able to interact with hardware (🌡️, 📹 , 🚦) thanks to  Docker? Could you transform your Raspberry Pi into an edge computing node, an  IoT on steroids 💪 or anything in between?

Extra Information
-----------------

The subject I address is not new but  not mainstream either (yet). I’ve been working on this subject for quite  a while now, and have lead a few workshops on this very subject in the [company](https://worldline.com/)  I work for. I have also written a few articles on ARM/Linux/Docker/Gitlab in my  company, and I am in the process of rewriting them to publish on [medium](https://medium.com/@poddingue) and on [Worldline Tech](https://blog.worldline.tech/).

> This is a feedback on experience, but there are quite a few technical takeaways.

You will find previous [slides] of my talks and twitter references [there].
